As expected, this was a very fun project. The minesweeper part suprisingly took less than the majority
of the time spent coding (menu features and flavor text taking the most time).

For this project, I spent very little time officialy planning. Typicly, I envision how I want to solve
an issue as I get to them. From there, I work out the specifics.

My proudest part of this project is both the ability to place flags with right click and the scale-
ability of the game grid using only one variable. The first one, because it is an essential part
of the game minesweeper that wasn't asked of us to add, and the second because it shows good
programming technique.

My most shameful part has to be the Menu class. At least 25% of my total project time was spent working
on that class trying to make something that worked because of how it's components function. Most of it
is redundant and could be cleaned up, but that would take more time.

In total, I must have spent ~12 hours total on this project. At least 30 minutes where spent playing
my own game, plus 2 hours wondering why buttons or status bars weren't appearing.
I probably wouldn't have saved any time nor saved myself any stress by doing pre-production on account
of those 2 hours of fumbling with built-in functionality.

Given a larger/more complex project, I may do some serious planning, but this one was simple enough to
where it was not a nessesity.
